**wahealththeme** has been adapted from **vpstheme**. It is designed as
a helper to enable R users across WA Heath to use the colours and fonts
defined in the [WA Health Style
Guide](https://doh-healthpoint.hdwa.health.wa.gov.au/directory/OfficeOfTheDirectorGeneral/Communications/Documents/Style-Guide.pdf)
to create compliant visualisations in ggplot and, eventually tables in
gt.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **vpstheme** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zerogetsamgow/vpstheme")
```

## Corporate style guide

At the core of **wahealtheme** are elements prescribed by the various WA
Health style guides including colours, palettes and fonts.

### Department of Health

The Department of Health colour palette consists of blah blah blah.
